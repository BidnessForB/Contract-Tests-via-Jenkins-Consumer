**The NOVA Security User Management API allows you to programmatically access NOVA network users and perform admin tasks.**

When integrating the NOVA Security User Management API with other systems, it is good practice to keep an eye on activity that may pose a security risk. 

You should have received instructions on setting up administrative roles and API keys when you received your invite to this workspace, but if you need assistance with that, please reach out to your manager and we can get those to you right away. 


## Associated Resources
- There is an **OpenAPI file** that was used to generate this collection, which you can find in the "APIs" tab on the left vertical sidebar. As the API itself evolves, we will use the two-way git sync to update the spec from Bitbucket to Postman, and thus translate those changes over to this documentation collection. 
- Be sure to check back to this collection before you start implementing, and click the Watch icon on the API to be alerted to any changes

- **Monitor**: Under the Monitors tab on the same vertical toolbar, we have set up a monitor that runs the collection once a day and displays the results of the tests. 
- **Mock Server**: As this API is liable to expose sensitive information, we have set up a mock server to return example responses. You can still send the requests, just make sure the `baseUrl` variable is filled in with the monitor url to receive a response.
- **Visualizations**: To make data easier to spot-check, we have implemented a visualization on the `GET All API Users` request that lets you search and filter users by their last login.

# Terms to Know

A **NOVA network user** is defined as any user who has logged on to your service that is monitored under the NOVA security umbrella. You can configure which services are covered in your partner portal. 


# Authentication

An API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the NOVA Security API, in the form of an `X-Api-Key` request header.  You can get your key from the NOVA security portal or through your manager or team administrator.

An API Key tells our API server that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.

For ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments) called `postman_api_key` and this [Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/network) will automatically use it to make API calls.



## Using the API Key as a query parameter

Every request that accepts API Key as `X-Api-Key` request header, also accepts the key when sent as `apikey` URL query parameter.

API key sent as part of the header has a higher priority in case you send the key using both request header and query parameter.
